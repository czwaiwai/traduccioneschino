::: details 7. I don't understand the huge diversity of rates on the Translators do not have an official body to regulate our prices.  

This means that we have to defend our interests through membership of professional associations. In my case, I have been a member of Asetrad from the very beginning, I share its approach and I fight for the quality of the profession.

Freelance translators have to pay a number of expenses: social security contributions, working materials, membership fees, training and refresher courses, etc.

If someone offers you a lower rate, it is probably because they do not meet all the requirements and their quality may be questionable. 

At traduccioneschino we offer quality translations.  We always guarantee quality at a good price. You should also know that we offer discounts both on the first translation you contract with me and on large volumes of translations.
